/*
    If reqs get finished then please remember to implement warp
    and remove all instances of Floor. 3D array have a ton of empty
    space and have almost caused this whole project to timeout and
    not run. It's much more efficient to just have each floor be
    rendered on its own. Forget realism; everything's bound to be
    bigger on the inside. This isn't a long-term game project anyway.
    Just make do with what works, and hope that you even finish it.
